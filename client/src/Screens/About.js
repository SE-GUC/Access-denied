              Technology is reforming the way work gets done so radically that
              all business domains are changing. All aspects of the professional
              work environment is rapidly evolving from workflow, processes and
              the very structure of organizations. Startups, with their creative
              ability to innovate, are competing and defeating major
              enterprises. Hence, itʼs no surprise this is called the disruptive
              era.

              A considerable number of enterprises are just selling their
              establishment and the facade of a strong grip. Theyʼre charging
              premium because they can, not because of the quality they produce.
              Pair that with the disruption caused by the changing economy, one
              can understand why enterprises are trying to change they way they
              operate. The are trying their best to attract talent as their need
              for innovative talent is higher than ever.

                The problem enterprises are facing is that they are unable to
                attract talent. Enterprises are also facing a hard time keeping
                their talented employees from leaving, specially the young
                change-enthusiasts. The bureaucracy, routine, non-ending lists
                of rules, unfair distribution of revenues and constraints are
                just the tip of the iceberg. In this day and age, the market is
                changing more rapidly than ever, and the talent demand is
                changing even faster. Highly creative people are increasingly
                refusing the traditional ”work as usual” lifestyle.

                This talent acquisition crisis that is addressed globally urged
                the enterprises to go further than they have ever went in trying
                to find a solution. Their salvation, they think, is Digital
                Transformation, one of the most trending buzzwords in the
                business world nowadays. Digital Transformation pushes
                enterprises in all domains to restructure themselves, their
                hierarchy and work-flow with to embracing the agile behavior,
                creating a more attractive work environment for highly talented
                people.

              Finally, even in this digital age, enterprises are just using a
              fraction of itʼs full potential. Companies are not making use of
              people available with their minds and talents, but not physically.
              The number of freelancers and digital nomads is increasing more
              than ever. Nevertheless, their presence in the traditional
              work-place to help and aid enterprises is much lower than it could
              be. Worse comes to worst when we notice that there is a massive
              availability of highly-talented, highly-motivated,
              extremely-creative and qualified work force that is neglected.

                This neglected workforce is simply none other than university
                students. Students are more than able to deliver and produce
                given a chance. Even more, those who didnʼt suffer the
                suffocation of a traditional office job tend to be more creative
                with their approaches and their problem solving abilities. So,
                enterprises and companies are as eager as ever to attract
                talent, change the way they operate and be more imaginative.
                And, we have a huge neglected work force that can create, work,
                produce yet theyʼre not given a chance. Finally, we have
                multi-talented creative people that prefer not to be constrained
                and they like the flexibility of freelancing. See the problem?
                At Lirten, we believe in students. We once were students. We
                know what students can do given a chance. We believe in freedom.
                We believe that the best set of rules is the minimal set of
                rules. You might think we want to fight well established
                organizations. On the contrary, We want to help them. Our ”help”
                comes through unlocking an unused potential that when directed
                correctly can only spark an economic growth that will benefit
                the entirety of the society.

              Isn’t that just any freelancing website? Well, there is a catch.
              trying to overcome the mess in the freelancing wolrd today. You
              see, traditionally if some company wanted to outsource, they would
              just post a description of a task and someone might do it or not.
              There were no guarantees and the allocation of tasks followed a
              sub-optimal procedure. LirtenHub aims to solve the missing piece
              of the puzzle. LirtenHub introduces the solution by resolving the
              traditional operation to itʼs fundamental constituents.
